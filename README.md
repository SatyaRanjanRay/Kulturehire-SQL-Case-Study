⚡ Here are some quick insights:

📌 The survey dataset includes 1733 male and 1181 female respondents from India, representing a gender ratio of 59.5% to 40.5%. This sample reflects the diversity and perspectives of the Indian GenZ population.

📌 One of the factors that affect the career aspirations of GenZ is parental influence. Out of the 443 respondents who reported being influenced by their parents, 187 (42.2%) were female and 256 (57.8%) were male. This suggests that parental influence may have a different impact on the career choices of male and female GenZ.

📌 Another factor that affects the career aspirations of GenZ is social media. Out of the 1254 respondents who answered this question, 103 (8.2%) reported being influenced by social media platforms, while 224 (17.9%) reported being influenced by influencers. This indicates that social media and influencers have a moderate impact on the career choices of GenZ compared to other factors.
